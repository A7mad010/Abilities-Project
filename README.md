# ðŸŽ® Educational Project: Ability System with Interfaces (SOLID & DRY Principles)

This Unity project demonstrates how to build a flexible and maintainable **ability system** using:

- âœ… **Interfaces** for clean and extendable behavior
- âœ… **SOLID principles** for scalable and decoupled architecture
- âœ… **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** practices to reduce redundancy

---

## âœ¨ Project Goals

- Implement modular gameplay abilities (e.g., heal, shoot)
- Write clean, organized, and reusable code
- Practice abstraction and code separation using interfaces

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- `IAbility` interface to define ability behavior
- Player interacts with abilities through a unified system
- Easy to extend with new abilities without modifying existing code
